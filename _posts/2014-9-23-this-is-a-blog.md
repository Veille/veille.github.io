Welcome to my learning blog! I call it a learning blog because i have both learnt how to make a blog by creating this page and also because I will be using it to document my learnings.

I have created this space to record myself diving deeping into C++ and hopefully some Golang (if I can find the right projects) to hopefully better equip myself to become a Network Programmer. 

### Initial Thoughts

I am hoping to do an initial refresher of the C++ language by working my way through some [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems and picking of some extra problem solving (and probably math) skills at the same time. Then I'm intending to work my way through some common CS algorithms to do a bit of a refresher after university. 

I felt as though writing about my experiences would help me consolidate my thoughts about topics I'm covering, and also give me a bit of a journal of knowledge that I won't lose. So far it has at least been an interesting lesson on learning how to set up Ruby and Jekyll!

We'll see how this site looks in the future as I tune it up a bit.

Enjoy!
